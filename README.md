**Project by: Vedansh Airen**

This is a part of **Independent Study** project for implementing a fine trajectory for a ball upron throwing it in VR.

Built with: Unity

Run this application on Oculus Quest 2 for the best experience.

The 4 main scripts are VRBallThrow, TargetSpawner, TargetFollower, and TargetCollisionDetector. These could be found in Assets > _Course Library > Scripts

VRBallThrow should be applied on the ball 3D object. 
TargetSpawner should be applied on the TargetPath empty 3D object (containing TargetPath points with tag "waypoints").
TargetFollower, and TargetCollisionDetector should be applied on the ARCHERY_Target Variant Prefab.
